      <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">The Problem with M&A</h2>
      <p>
        Here's the cold, hard truth: mergers & acquisitions (M&A) in the food
        and agribusiness sectors are tough. M&A is viewed as an accelerant to
        growth — an express lane — but there is a downside. Once you get on the
        expressway, things move fast, and there are few off ramps. In fact, many
        M&A deals destroy more value than they create.
      </p>
      <p>
        For most food and agribusiness executives performing M&A, integration is
        an afterthought. There are so many moving pieces in an integration, they
        don't know where to start:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What's the integration going to look like?</li>
        <li>How long is this going to take?</li>
        <li>How do we avoid making stupid decisions?</li>
        <li>Who's going to be involved?</li>
        <li>How do we avoid wasting time and/or money?</li>
        <li>Why are we doing this again?</li>
        <li>Can we actually pull this thing off?</li>
        <li>What if we get it wrong?</li>
        <li>
          What does it mean to our customers, suppliers, and our employees if
          this goes sideways?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A failed M&A integration sets the company back years. It creates
        performance and financial pressure that didn't exist before the deal,
        leaves leadership doubting themselves, and results in a business
        hesitant to drive bold and innovative strategy.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your employee and customer confidence erodes</li>
        <li>Your credibility as a leader is crushed</li>
        <li>You lose ground to traditional and emerging competitors</li>
        <li>
          And your poorly executed deal consumes capital with subpar returns
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Don't wait another second. You owe it to your team, customers,
        suppliers, and community to ensure your M&A deal creates value with
        minimal disruption. Book your call now and we'll create an Integration
        Readiness Roadmap you can use to get started.

              <p>His impact was apparent as various senior leaders reached out to him for informal counsel or direct support when struggling to drive strategy.

Throughout the project, Joe maintained a steady focus on delivering results and value above any personal agenda or benefit."</p>

          <p>Hi, I’m Joe Mosher, founder of Mosher Consulting Group and <cite>The Integration Pacesetter</cite>. We help food and agribusiness companies scale their business, deliver profitable results, set their people up for future success, all while preserving the core and culture of what your business stands for.</p>

<p>For more than 15 years, we’ve been supporting food and agribusiness executives in executing their strategy and realizing their value from their M&amp;A activities. We are hyper focused on the small to middle market food and agribusiness sector — it’s what we know and what we love.</p>

<p>We don’t just talk that talk, we walk the walk. We’ve spent the majority of our careers working within food and agribusiness companies — not as external advisors, but as business operators.</p>

<p>We’ve lead strategy execution from a variety of perspectives including:</p>

        </p>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Plant Operations</li>
          
          <li>Finance</li>
          
          <li>Risk & Assurance</li>
          
          <li>Process Improvement</li>
          
          <li>Organization Effectiveness</li>
          
          <li>And Business Transformation</li>
          
        </ul>
        <p class="large text-muted">
          <p>Because we’ve been in the business, we know how hard it is to get strategy and M&amp;A execution right. We’ve been through brutal harvests, major quality and inventory issues, supplier and customer disputes, plant closures, business turnarounds, and challenging acquisitions. We know how tough it is to manage the dual mandate of driving value creation through growth, while ensuring value preservation by defending the existing business.</p>

<p>Since we are seasoned business leaders — NOT career consultants — we speak from experience, not untested theories.</p>

<p>That’s why privately owned food and agribusiness executives trust Mosher Consulting Group to generate more profits, increase their bottom line, and change the growth trajectory of their business forever.</p>
