    title: "Meet Joe"
    text: "The Mosher Consulting Group is my commitment to supporting the sustainable growth and success of this sector of the economy."
    subtext: "Over more than two decades, I have had the good fortune to build a challenging and diversified
career with experiences in management consulting, plant op\erations, process improvement,
internal process control auditing, global risk and assurance leadership, and driving large-scale
change. These opportunities included serving in both individual contributor and management
roles of large multi-site and globally distributed teams.
Most recently from 2008 to 2021, I held senior roles at Cargill, Inc., a privately held firm serving
food, agriculture, financial, and industrial customers with more than 1,200 facilities across nearly
70 countries.
I hold a bachelor’s in political science specializing in economic development, and a master’s in organization development, from the
University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.
Mosher Consulting Group (plus logo?)
I founded Mosher Consulting Group on the operating thesis that extending access to strategy
execution advisory services beyond large firms and multinationals addresses an unmet need in
the market.
Small- and middle-market businesses are essential to a growing and prosperous U.S. economy,
yet they disproportionately suffer from economic slowdowns and downturns."
